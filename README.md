# Project Euler Solutions

There are my [Project Euler][project-euler] solutions written in TypeScript.

Each solution analysis can be found in my [website][website].

## Solutions

Usually there are more than one solution. The purpose of this project not just solve the *Euler Project* problems, but also to find more ways to get the solution.

## Tests

To run the tests use `pnpm run test` command.
